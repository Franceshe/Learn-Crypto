## Fun fact about crypto eco system
- Crypto pricing:
    - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stellar
- key organization:
    - [[Stellar Development Foundation]]
	- [Libra](https://developers.libra.org/docs/libra-protocol)
- key people:
    - Jed McCaleb: Co founder of Stellar Development Foundation
    - [Hanjian Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janhxie/?originalSubdomain=cn)
	- [Balaji S. Srinivasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajissrinivasan/) 
	
- [[DAO]]:
    - decentralized autonomous organization, or a DAO
        - DAO could be used to formulate the **future of company**:
            - In short, DAOs aim to hard-code certain rules that a company would from the get-go. This could be setting aside a certain percentage of earnings for a cause or determining a process by which such a rule could be changed.
            - The big difference is that the rules of normal companies are not enforced digitally.
            - I can imagine future stock and option allocation like Carta could be implemented this way

- [[Defi]]:
    - [What is Defi](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/)
    - [wiki about Defi](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DeFi_(Decentralized_Finance))
- [[dapps]]:
    - [etherum dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/)
    - Decentralized application
    - DeFi is implemented through [dApps](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DApps), which are usually built on either a [blockchain](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Blockchain) like [Ethereum](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Ethereum) or a tangle like [IOTA](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=IOTA).[[1]](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DeFi_(Decentralized_Finance)#cite_note-1)
        - 4 principles behind Defi Network:
            - interoperability
            - accessibility 
            - inclusion
            - transparency.
    - What kind of apps could be built upon such platform?
        - The [**ethereum white paper**](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications) splits dapps into three types: apps that manage money, apps where money is involved (but also requires another piece), and apps in the “other” category, which includes voting and governance systems.

## Thoughts
- Why bitcoin, blockchain and other forms of new crypto currency matters?
    - 在一个完整的广告系统架构中，数据的记录、交易、流转、建模和使用，因为这些是广告系统最核心的驱动力
    - 同理，在交易流转的过程中，数字货币的分布式账本（数据库）同样起到了记录数据的记录，交易，和使用。


## Interesting application
* Use Crypto as login intead of FB or User/Pass/or old fashioned OAUTH protocol
... - using crypto wallet to login into apps wihout giving up identity or privacy
... - using digital signature as alternative to old login mechanisim
### 
* Any application requried or could take advantage of open state or open execution 
database
* Incorportate on Chain, which is similar to Stripe Atlas


## Problem to Solve
* How to unblock transactions with increasing trasaction volume?
* How to safely secure crypto assests, in theory, as long as there's 
internent connection, malware could extrude system. Cold offline hardware
seems the valid option but add friction in trasaction.

## Related Concept:
* Turing-complete:
* "Turing-complete programming language": 
... What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.
