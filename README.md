- [[DAO]]:
    - decentralized autonomous organization, or a DAO
        - DAO could be used to formulate the **future of company**:
            - In short, DAOs aim to hard-code certain rules that a company would from the get-go. This could be setting aside a certain percentage of earnings for a cause or determining a process by which such a rule could be changed.
            - The big difference is that the rules of normal companies are not enforced digitally.
            - I can imagine future stock and option allocation like Carta could be implemented this way

- [[Defi]]:
    - [What is Defi](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/)
    - [wiki about Defi](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DeFi_(Decentralized_Finance))
- [[dapps]]:
    - [etherum dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/)
    - Decentralized application
    - DeFi is implemented through [dApps](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DApps), which are usually built on either a [blockchain](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Blockchain) like [Ethereum](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Ethereum) or a tangle like [IOTA](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=IOTA).[[1]](http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=DeFi_(Decentralized_Finance)#cite_note-1)
        - 4 principles behind Defi Network:
            - interoperability
            - accessibility 
            - inclusion
            - transparency.
    - What kind of apps could be built upon such platform?
        - The [**ethereum white paper**](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#applications) splits dapps into three types: apps that manage money, apps where money is involved (but also requires another piece), and apps in the “other” category, which includes voting and governance systems.

## Thoughts
- Why bitcoin, blockchain and other forms of new crypto currency matters?
    - 在一个完整的广告系统架构中，数据的记录、交易、流转、建模和使用，因为这些是广告系统最核心的驱动力
    - 同理，在交易流转的过程中，数字货币的分布式账本（数据库）同样起到了记录数据的记录，交易，和使用。
